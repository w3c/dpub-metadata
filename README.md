## Technical note ##

Note that there are two documents (index.html and interviews.html) that constitute the full report. There is a small jQuery function at the beginning of both documents that mutually link the two documents by modifying the table of content headers. That function is invoked via respec.

Also, the acronym list in the appendix is stored in a separate file (acronym.html) and is included, via respec, into both documents, thereby ensuring consistency.
