The [Digital Publishing Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG), that managed this repository, ***is now closed***, and so is this repository. Activities in the group has been taken up by:

* The [Publishing Business Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-bg)
* The [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-bg)
* The [EPUB 3 Community Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub3-cg)

All these groups are part of the [Publishing@W3C](https://www.w3.org/publishing), born out of the merger of IDPF and W3C.

## Technical note ##

Note that there are two documents (index.html and interviews.html) that constitute the full report. There is a small jQuery function at the beginning of both documents that mutually link the two documents by modifying the table of content headers. That function is invoked via respec.

Also, the acronym list in the appendix is stored in a separate file (acronym.html) and is included, via respec, into both documents, thereby ensuring consistency.
